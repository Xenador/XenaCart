//MOST IMPORTANT NOTE

//** I we change the state of any of the hook than the whole component will render itself Again a component will be rerenderd only if any data or the state of any if the data will be changed or change in props will also lead to rerendering of the component **/
//** Actually what happens is all the code we are currently wirting is comverted to the virtual dom by the react than  

//**********************************************DEFINE RECONCIALLATION************************************************

//**  When we are actually changing something or for eg we are removing some card from the our home component than our react will first creat a coopy the old virtual dom than it will create a new virtual dom which will not be having those cards thsn in case of execution the react
//  will compare these two virtual doms on the basis of that coparison those two psrticular cards will be removed from the old virtual dom and this property of react makes it really very fast*
// *The concept of the react with the help of which it differientiates the old virtual dom and new virtual dom is called the recounselalation snd this whole procedure is called react fibres this github also do the same thing this whole concept is called the concept of the virtual dom that's why react is really fast
// react does not support routing so for performing the routing react uses the react router dom*/

/*                                 CONDITONAL RENDERING
The term conditional rendering refers to the fact of fetching the data from the url*/ 

/*                                 Prop Drilling                  
**There is problem called prop drilling that when in a dom when we are required to send the data from
one component to another we will perform the prop drilling or prop lifting from different components which may not even require that particular data 
so to solve this prolblem we use the conteext api which can directly pass that particular data from one component to another without passing to different another comonents */


//*                               Client side and Server side rendering 

//                                       Client side rendering

//This is basically the concept when the whole web page is downloaded at the client or the browser side in one inital call

//                                        Server side rendering 

//Server side rendering refers to the scenerio when whole web page is at the server side and the client or browser downloads the data as per when required in small quatity

//                                            Pros and cons
//Inital Render :- server side rendering has less initial rendering time(better in this case)
//After initial render :- After initial render client side rendering takes less in diferent processes

//                                 Lazy loading/ Chunking / OnDemand loading
//in case of swiggy the code components of the swiggyinstamart will only be downloaded only if the oser demands to use the swiggy instamart
//incase of onDemand rendering when we clicked on the  food compnent react imported or downloaded the food component before it gets fully downloaded 
//thats why its giving us the error

//                                    why react is called SPA(Single Page Component)
//->React is called single page component because react creates a single document and updates the parts of that single page document instead of reloading the whole document 
//that why react is very fast and is called SPA that is single page document

//                                     Controlled and uncontrolled components 
//->Components that have there own state and the feilds of that components shall change corresponfing to the state of that component is 
//called controlled component


//                                     State lifting and prop lifting 
//->Whenever we send the prop from the child component to the parent component its called prop lifting or the statelifting


//                                      Clear Component or clear state or clean up function for the optimization
//this function will be called and keep on running after every half a second and 
//the concering part is that it will keep of running even if the cart component is closed this will significantly affect the performance of our project thats why its important to close or clear this 
//this the clear function that will be called after the cart component is closed this will particularly stop all the ongoing tasks in the component
